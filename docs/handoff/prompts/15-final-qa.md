# 15 — Final QA, documentation and packages

Do: run the full QA-CHECKLIST on the user's PC (GPU=1), fix regressions, update README.md (Russian: features, controls, params, requirements), ARCHITECTURE.md, CREDITS.md, STATUS.md; build the desktop packages (package 07) and a source archive; record a demo video (tools/demo.mjs) of the 5-minute manual tour.
Acceptance: all checks green, packages start on a clean Ubuntu user account, documentation matches the build.

## Common instructions

Read AGENTS.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/handoff/README.md, STATUS.md, BUDGETS.md, DIAGRAMS.md and QA-CHECKLIST.md first.
Work on branch `release/final` (create it from the current main line; if a WIP branch is named below, start from it and merge the main line in).
Target: Ubuntu, NVIDIA RTX 3060 6 GB, 1920x1080 at 60 fps on the ultra preset; run the tools with GPU=1 so you measure the real GPU.
Scope: you may edit only docs, tools, small fixes anywhere. Anything else: minimal hooks, listed in your final summary.
Definition of done: everything in "Acceptance" below, `npx vite build` passes, `npm run smoke` passes (extend it with checks for your feature), screenshots of the affected views at ultra 1920x1080 day (t=600) and night (t=2000) saved under shots/final/ and reviewed critically against real photos/references, performance within BUDGETS.md (fps.mjs with governor=0, cpuframe.mjs before/after), docs updated (ARCHITECTURE.md, README.md in Russian, CREDITS.md for assets, docs/handoff/STATUS.md). Commit in small steps with clear English messages. Finish with a short report: what changed, measurements, screenshots, open issues.
